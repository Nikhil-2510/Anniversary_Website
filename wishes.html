My dear Tannu,

Happy 3rd Anniversary! üíñ  
May you always be happy and keep that beautiful smile on your face.

I know we got together unexpectedly, and initially it was a difficult situation for you...  
But you always loved me, even during the tough times.  
Whenever you got angry at me, you still forgave me ‚Äî  
You accepted my apologies and made everything feel right again.

I hope you‚Äôll always cherish the beautiful memories we‚Äôve created ‚Äî  
Dancing together, eating our favorite food,  
Celebrating New Year‚Äôs, birthdays, previous anniversaries,  
Valentine‚Äôs Days, freshers, and so many other lovely moments.

I wish you always remain the same sweet, loving person‚Ä¶  
And I promise to give my best to keep you happy forever.

With all my heart,  
Nikku ‚ù§Ô∏è`;
